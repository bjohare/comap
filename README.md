# comap
Community Mapping Application

Comap is a mapping application for users in the heritage / outdoor leisure / tourism sectors who wish to publish local
place-based data to the web. Comap allows users to create an online map of a local route, for example a walking route, 
heritage trail or any other routes of local interest and to associate points of interest with these routes. Rich
media can be added to these waypoints to provide contextual information about particular local features. Comap is 
devloped in python using django, geodjango and the django rest framework and provides a REST api for developers. It uses jQuery, HTML5 and Twitter Bootstrap for the UI and is deployed to AWS.
